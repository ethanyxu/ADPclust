\title{Automatically find cluster assignment given f and delta.}
\usage{
FindClustersAuto(
  distm,
  f,
  delta,
  ac = 1,
  nclust = 2:10,
  f.cut = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{distm}{the distance matrix}

\item{f}{vector of local distance f(x). See the help of adpclust() for details.}

\item{delta}{vector of minimal distances to higher ground delta(x). See the help of adpclust() for details.}

\item{ac}{type of auto selection. The valid options are 1 and 2. See the help of adpclust() for details.}

\item{nclust}{number of clusters to test. Either a single integer or a vector of integers.}

\item{f.cut}{number between (0, 1) or numeric vector of numbers between (0, 1). Data points whose f values are larger than f.cut with large delta values are selected as centers. The default is c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3). See the help of FindCentersAutoV() for more details.}
}
\value{
list of four elements: 
\itemize{
\item{clusters}{ Cluster assignments. A vector of the same length as the number of observations.}
\item{centers:}{ Indices of the clustering centers.}
\item{silhouette:}{ Silhouette score from the final clustering result.}
\item{nclust:}{ Number of clusters.}
}
}
\description{
This is the subroutine that automatically finds cluster assignments from given f and delta by testing various parameter settings and find the one that maximizes the silhouette.
